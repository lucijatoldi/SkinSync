# SkinSync - An Ontology-Based Expert System for Skin Disease Diagnosis

## üìñ About The Project

**SkinSync** is a web application that functions as an **expert system**, providing users with informational support in identifying potential skin diseases based on selected symptoms and affected body parts.

The core of the system is a **knowledge base modeled as an RDF ontology**. This graph-based approach allows for a flexible and powerful representation of the complex relationships between medical entities. Queries against the knowledge base are executed using the **SPARQL** query language, enabling logical inference.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Intelligent Diagnostics:** The system dynamically constructs SPARQL queries to search the knowledge graph and find conditions that match the user's input.
* **Detailed Results:** For each potential diagnosis, the application displays recommended treatments and known triggers to avoid.
* **User Authentication & Profiles:** A built-in user management system based on Django for registration and authentication.
* **PDF Report Generation:** Logged-in users can generate and download a personalized PDF document with their diagnosis results.
* **Automated Testing:** The project includes both unit and integration tests, written using Django's test framework, to ensure code quality and reliability.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

* **Backend:** Python, Django
* **Knowledge Base:** rdflib (for working with the RDF graph), SPARQL
* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* **Document Generation:** ReportLab
* **Testing:** Django Test Framework
* **Database (Users):** SQLite
